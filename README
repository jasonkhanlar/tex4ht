This file is public domain.  Originally written 2009, Karl Berry.

This is tex4ht, a package to convert LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other

Bug reports: please include enough information for the maintainers to
reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of tex4ht and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.
- email the report to tex4ht@tug.org (subscribing first is not required).

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them using diff -c, and
include ChangeLog entries.

Installation:
  Unfortunately, we cannot write a simple description of how to install
  tex4ht.  We hope to improve this in the future.  For terse information
  on how it is installed in TeX Live, see the file
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-4ht.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TeX4ht was created by Eitan Gurari at Ohio State University,
who died unexpectedly in June 2009.  We miss you, Eitan.

With the permission and encouragement of Eitan's family,
CV Radhakrishnan, Karl Berry, and others have taken over maintenance of the
package, and welcome other volunteers.  Any involvement, from bug reports
to major new development, is appreciated.
