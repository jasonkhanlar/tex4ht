\chapter{Introduction}

\TeX{}4ht is a \TeX{} package created and developed by
Eitan~M. Gurari, who was Associate Professor of Computer Science
at Ohio State University until his premature death on June~22,
2009.  Our continuing work on his software is dedicated to his memory.

\TeX{}4ht translates documents written in \TeX{} or any of its common
variants (\LaTeX{}, Con\TeX{}t, etc.)\ into other markup formats, such
as HTML, XML, SGML, etc., optionally using MathML or other formats,
with nearly endless possibilities for customization.  The home page of
the project is \url{http://tug.org/tex4ht}.  The software is released
under the \LaTeX{} Project Public License, version 1.3 or later.

The present document is currently focused on maintenance of \TeX{}4ht
itself, which includes hundreds of \TeX{} packages, hypertext fonts, C
and Java programs, DTDs, all wrapped in a (homegrown) literate
programming style.

\TeX{}4ht is currently maintained by CV Radhkrishnan and Karl Berry
(the ``\TeX{}4ht Project''); we would be very grateful for additional
volunteers.  The development site, mailing lists, etc., are also
linked from \url{http://tug.org/tex4ht}.
