# This script is a make file for tex4ht.  It is written in bash
# but should be simple to translate into csh, perl or whatever your platform 
# prefers.
# Original author: Kai-Mikael J‰‰-Aro <kai@popwire.com>
# 
# This code is placed under the LaTeX Project Public License 
# (http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt).
#
# Motivation:
# The LaTeX file has to be compiled until the dvi file stabilises.  
# We check on auxiliary files to determine if a new compilation will change 
# anything or if we are done now.
#
# This script takes seven arguments:
# $1 The LaTeX file
# $2 Files to be included by latex
# $3 Options to tex4ht, of which the first must be a font directory
# $4 Options to t4ht
# $5 Options to latex/tex
# $6 Package inclusions to create the desired type of document 
# $7 A user-supplied script which will be executed each time around the loop
# $8 A user-supplied test which should have an exit value of 0 if we need to 
#    compile the file again. 
# 
# Sometimes, typically due to moving page references in the text, a file will 
# never converge, so there is a checkpoint every TEX4HTLIMIT iterations 
# (default 10).  If TEX4HTBATCH is set the script will just exit the loop, 
# otherwise it asks the user whether to continue.  If the output is 
# deemed not to have converged, the script will return a status of 1, 
# otherwise 0.

  # can decide if they hadn't better check what's going on.  
  # (I prefer this to a fixed cut-out as tex4ht does not have a known upper 
  #  limit on the number of iterations necessary for unknown input.)

  # Both BibTeX and makeindex are fairly quick operations, so I simply redo

  # If this is a problem, a more sophisticated check of the contents of the

  # This is the logic here:
  # If LaTeX tells us we need to rerun, we do so without further discussion,
  # otherwise we check if any of the .4tc, .xref, .aux files is different from 
  # the previous version.  
  # Finally we use the user-supplied test to see if there is anything more to do.
  # If none of these tests trigger, we're done.
