This file is public domain.  Originally written 2010, Karl Berry.

Eitan devised his own literate programming system, which supports
multiple output files from a single source (http://ctan.org/pkg/protex).
The files here are such "literate" source files.  They are processed
with (ht)(la)tex, as given by commands at the top.

This directory contains do-nothing scripts named xmllint and vcss, which
are called for validation via tex4ht-env.tex.  (Of course they won't be
used unless . is early enough in PATH.)  The real xmllint can take a
long time to run, and fails to find the DTD on the tex4ht-docbook*.html
output, for no apparent reason.
