    % Eitan's active definition started like this:
    %\def\CleanComment#1tex4ht-info#2#3#4.#5>#6//{[#4%     <--jobname
    %
    % However, that didn't work either.  #4 is not the jobname. 
    % The arguments when running htlatex tex4ht-info-mml.tex are these:
    % %#1<-
    %\CleanComment #1tex4ht-info#2#3#4.#5>#6//->
    %[\if ,\ifnum \FIRST =#6 .\else ,0\fi

    %#4<-ml
    %#5<-html#QPrTx1"\<infomml\
    %#6<-92\ifx \CodeId \:gobbleii \else ...\fi 
    %
    % As a result, when running  mzlatex hello.tex xhtml,info  there was
    % an error on the first line of infomml.4ht, which looked like this:
    % \ifx\infoIVht\UnDeF\def\infoIVht#1//{}\fi\infoIVht[ml0]28...//
    % That "ml" is not a number, so \ifnum fails.  This only happens
    % mzlatex and the info option, not htlatex.  We don't understand.
    %
    % This version avoids the spurious "ml" but mzlatex hello.tex still
    % fails, trying to process the \ConfigureHinput blocks as text.
    % Changing the bracketed number in infomml.4ht to small values seems
    % to make it pass, but can't see how to generate it.  The number
    % after the brackets (#6) changes also.
    % 
    % Since all this is only about the info option with mzlatex,
    % just leaving it failing for now.  Other things to do.
